Describe your php experience?

Although, my experience with developing web applications in PHP not too long but
I have thorough understaning of the web development process. I have been writing my backend code in PHP 7.2
and I try to fully utilize all the latest new functions and plugins.
In my free time I have been preparing to pass my exam for Zend PHP Certification hoping to show my passion for PHP.



Tell Us about project you worked:


I am a part of the small-to-mid size development team and we have been working on a project that creates custom surveys and tests for the customer.
My role is to provide frontend and backend support by writing new codes and implement the new changes on an existing code.
Writing code and following the best practices has always been my goal, therefore, not matter how big or small code I write I always make sure the code is properly
written and met all the industry's standards.
