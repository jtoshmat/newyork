            Priorities determine what actually has to happen first.
            What are the "must do" activities, which if not done
            will stall the whole OERu initiative.

            Strategic planning at the OERu is a dynamic, iterative
            and complex process. The OERu is an open collaboration
            involving over thirty partners from five continents
            and many of the planning activities rely on volunteer
            contributions from the community. We also need to
            consider perspective and focus. OER partners join the
            collaboration for a variety of different reasons.
            What is considered important for one member may not
            carry the same level of importance or interest for
            another partner in the network. The different
            stakeholder groups within the planning process also
            have different interests and priorities.
