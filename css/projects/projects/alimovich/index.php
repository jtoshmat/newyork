<p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
    industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
    ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
    type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
    not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
    the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
    recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
    versions of Lorem Ipsum.
